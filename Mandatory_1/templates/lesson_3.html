    <h3>Strict mode</h3>
    <p>It is a way to opt-in into stricter variant of Javascript, therefore exiting out of "sloppy mode". 
        It is important to now that it is not subset of JavaScript, but it has different semantics. Some 
        browsers do not support strict mode. They will run code in strict mode with different behavior.
        Use statement below at the beginning of the file to use strict mode.
    </p>

    <pre class="short-pre-l3">"use strict";</pre>

    <h3>Variable declaration</h3>
    <p>Variable declaration can be done in 4 different ways. </p>
    <pre>
        const variable1 = 1;
        let variable2 = 2;
        var variable3 = 3;
        variable4 = 4;</pre>

    <p>As it can be done in 4 different ways, the functionality changes in different declaration methods.
        As a rule of thumb, it is advised to use "let" as much as possible compared to "var". "let" variables can be updated, but can't 
        be re-declared. "var" variables can be updated and re-declared. "const" variables can't be updated or re-declared. "const" is 
        used whenever we know that the value of the variable won't change.
    </p>

    <h3>Are Objects immutable in JavaScript ?</h3>
    <p>Objects are mutable unless we use Object.freeze() functionality on them.</p>
    <pre>const myMutableObject {
            attribute: "not changed"
        }
        console.log(myMutableObject.attribute);
        myMutableObject.attribute = "changed";
        console.log(myMutableObject.attribute);

        // Expected output: not changed
                            changed</pre>

    <p>However, if we would like to make our objects immutable, we need to use Object.freeze().</p>
    <pre>myImmutableObject = Object.freeze({
            attribute: "not changed"
        });
        console.log(myImmutableObject.attribute);
        myImmutableObject.attribute = "changed";
        console.log(myImmutableObject.attribute);

        // Expected output: not changed
                            not changed</pre>

    <h3>Scopes</h3>
    <p>JavaScript scope determines the availability/accesibility and visibility of our variables.
        We can differentiate between 2 types of scopes. GLOBAL and LOCAL. Variables in Global scope are all variables 
        which are declared outside of function. Variables which are declared inside of a function, immediately become Local 
        scope.
    </p>
    <pre>
        let variable1 = "abc";
        {
            let variable1 = 123;
        }
        console.log(variable1);

        // Expected output: abc</pre>

    <h3>Type Coercion</h3>
    <p>Type Coercion is process of converting value from one type to another. All types (primitive or objects)
        can be subjects of coercion.
    </p>
    <pre>
        let variableA;
        let variableB;

        console.log(variableA + variableB);
        console.log(variableA, variableB);

        // Expected output: NaN
                            undefined undefined</pre>

    <h3>Problem when we use "var" inside of For-Loop</h3>
    <p>As we said before, there are 3 ways to declare a variable. We need to declare a variable 
        when we are defining a For-Loop. We have 3 options when we want to declare a variable.
        1) const - If we use const in for loop, it will immediately crash as const variables can't be 
        updated or re-declared. If we declare i as const to be equal 0, at the second iteration when i will
        be incremented, it will crash.
        2) var - If we use var in for loop, seemingly it will work great, but in reality, if we declare i to be var, 
        then every i in the file will follow i from for loop. That is because var can be redeclared and updated and is visible globaly.
        3) let - way to go ! 
    </p>
    <pre>
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            setTimeout(() => {
                // this code will run after 1 second
                console.log(i);
            }, 1000);
        }

        // Expected output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</pre>

    <pre>
        for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            setTimeout(() => {
                // this code will run after 1 second
                console.log(i);
            }, 1000);
        }

        // Expected output: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9</pre>

    <h3>Nodemon, what is it and what is it used for ?</h3>
    <p>nodemon is a tool that makes developing Node.js applications easier by continuously looking at the project folder
        and detecting changes. When he detects a change, it immediately stops the run of some file and re-runs it. By doing so, it ensures that the 
        current running version of our file is latest and contains of the all changes. When we are working with nodemon, we have 3 options: <br>
        - install only for this project 
        <br><span>$ npm install --save-dev nodemon</span><br>

        - install globaly in system so it can be used for any and all projects 
        <br><span>$ npm install -g nodemon</span><br>

        - use dependency without installing nodemon 
        npx nodemon &lt;file_name&gt;<br><br>

        To stop the nodemon re-running file, just press: <br>
        <span>Ctrl + C</span><br>
    </p>

    <h3>Semantic Versioning</h3>
    <p>Semantic Versioning is a versioning scheme for using meaningful version numbers (that's why it is cal
        led Semantic Versioning). Specifically, the meaning revolves around how API versions compare in terms 
        of backwards-compatibility.
