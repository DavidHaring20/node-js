        <h3>Creating and interacting with .json file</h3>
        <p>Making .json file is really easy. When you are creating new file of type json, give it any name and add .json extension.</p>

        <div class="span-in-div">
            <span>scorpion.js</span>
        </div>

        <p>Now we can interact with it. First let's write something inside of it:</p>
        <pre>
            {
                "name": "Johny",
                "color": "black", 
                "length": "15cm",
                "venomous": "true"
            }</pre>

        <p>Now that we have .json file which has some data, now we can read from it.</p>
        <pre>
            const scorpion = require("path/to/scorpion.json");
            console.log(scorpion);

            // Expected output: { name: 'Johny', color: 'black', length: '15cm', venomous: 'true' }</pre>

        <h3>Http Methods</h3>
        <p>We have covered 5 main Http methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT and PATCH.
            We use Get when we want to read some data or request a specific resource. We use Post 
            when we want to create some resource and send it to some storing infrastructure(database). 
            We use Delete when we remove a resource. It can be either remove all of the resources or remove 
            specific. We can use Path variable to select specific resource of deleting. We use Put when we want to 
            update existing resource, but we need to update whole resource. We use this when we know that the body
            of a whole resource will change. We use Patch when we need to update only parts of an existing resource. 
            We can update small amount or big amount but not whole resource.
        </p>

        <h3>Advanced turning on the server</h3>
        <p>As we already said, the command in Express which is responsbile for turning on the server is: </p> 
        <div class="span-in-div">
            <span>app.listen(&lt;port_number&gt;);</span>
        </div>

        <p>With this approach everything works fine and there are no errors, but there is no option to see the port itself 
            or to see error if it exists. Therefore, we need to add some modification to this method. New method looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
            app.listen(8080, (error) => {
                if (error) {
                    console.log(error);
                } else {
                    console.log("Server is running on port", 8080);
                }
            });</pre>

        <p>This new app.listen will ensure that we get some output in the console if the run was successfull or if the run 
            crashed. If it crashed, it will give us the error or if it was successfull we will get something alongside these lines: 
        </p>
        <div class="span-in-div extra-space-bottom">
            <span>App is running on server port 8080</span>
        </div>


        <h3>Serving the HTML files with Express</h3>
        <p>To achieve this, firtsly we need 2 things: fully function server which was previously set up and "__dirname". 
            Setting up the server is made in __ steps. Firstly create package.json, then add dependency, package name and version number.
            Then npm install it. Then create app.js and import express from node_modules. Then set app to use express and turn on the server. 
        </p>

        <h3>What is "__dirname" ?</h3>
        <p>__dirname is used in JavaScrip as an environment variable. It essentially returns the path to the file we are using it in. Therefore 
            it is really useful as it can enable multiple people using same program on multiple operating systems by having independent file location.
            If our folder structure looked something like this:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
            path/to/folder/ - folder1 - file1 
                                    - file2 

                            - folder2 - myProjectFolder - myFile.js</pre>


        <p>If we would use the "__dirname" in myFile.js, we would get that the "__dirname" is equal to this: </p>
        
        <div class="span-in-div">
            <span>path/to/folder/folder2/myProjectFolder</span>
        </div>

        <p>Now, once we understand __dirname, we can move to an actual serving of Html pages.</p>

        <h3>Use  "__dirname" to serve HTML pages</h3>
        <p>We already have configured server. Now we need to just add this:</p>

        <pre>
            app.get("/", (req, res) => {
                res.sendFile(__dirname + "/myFile.js");
            });</pre>

        <p>We can then run the app.js and go to <strong>localhost:8080</strong> and we will get am HTML page.</p>
    </div>
</body>
