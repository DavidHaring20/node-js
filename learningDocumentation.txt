LESSON 1 
First part of the lesson was concentrated on installing Node js and getting it ready for use and getting some kind of basic understanding what Node js is.
Furthermore, we have learned why is it used and most importantly where it is used. 
During the second part of the first lesson we have had basic exercises which were crucial to be able to write Javascript code.
We have mostly concentrated on Data types such as: Strings, Objects and Arrays. There were different exercises for 
every Data type, but in general they were about Data manipulation and basic methods for that kind of Data. 
For example: 
    - Strings: showing the number with specified number of decimals(.toFixed()), getting the letter at specified index(.charAt()), 
        replacing the letter at specified index(.replace())...
    - Arrays: outputting the letter at the specified index using the console log(name_of_array[]), creating and populating the array, 
        searching for a specific number(.indexOf())...
    - Objects: initializing the objects, trying to output through console log some property of the object, removing the property of 
        some object using "delete" keyword...
After we have had some code which could be ran, we have then learned how to run that code. We used command "node <file_name>". 
But, needless to say, it would only work once the terminal was in the right directory where the file with the <file_name> could be found.

LESSON 2 
Lesson 2 had a steeper learning curve and was more challenging than the 1. lesson. During the 2. lesson, we have came across few different topics:
    - functions
    - callback functions
    - hoisting
    - REST APIs
We have learned how to write functions, how to define them and how to call them. Then, we have learned how to write functions which can take arguments and later, 
we have learned how to write callback functions. At the end of the lesson we have had brief introduction into server production and Express. We have seen how the 
GET Http Request is written for server side. 

LESSON 3 
Lesson 3 was concentrated aroud variables and Express. First part of the lesson, was about variables and second one was about Server.
During the first part of the lesson, we have covered: 
    - strict mode = restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "sloppy mode". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from normal code.
    - variable declaration 
    - object immutability
    - comparing
    - scopes
    - why not to use let in for-loop
In the second part of the lesson, we have worked on Server. We have made new Server from Scratch and we have made few simple 
GET requests and method which responds to that GET Request. We have learned more about:
    - node modules folder
    - package.json 
    - package-lock.json
    - Express 
    - Nodemon 
    - Semantic Versioning
We have also installed Nodemon. It is an extension which auto re-runs the script -> it presses Ctrl + C for us and runs it again. It 
is made so that it detects changes in the file/directory it has been called upon. We installed it by writing: 
    $ nodemon -g install
And we can use it by writing: 
    $ nodemon <file_name>
To gain complete understanding, we have then learned more about "npm install" and various ways to add dependencies to our package.json file.
There are 3 different ways to instantiate the variable: 
    - var(variable) - can be uptaded and re-declared
    - let(let something to happen) - can be updated, but not re-declared
    - const(constant) - can't be updated or redeclared 
As a general rule, use let as much as possible and var only on ocasssions. Use const when you are sure something won't be changed or updated.
USE "let" IN FOR LOOPS. IF YOU USE "var" I WILL PRODUCE SOME ERRORS, BUT IF YOU USE "const" IT WON'T WORK, BECAUSE "const" CAN'T BE UPDATED OR RE-DECLARED.
